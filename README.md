# Replicated-Site

Completed as part of the Odin Project curriculum (@ https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).


Project goal: reacreate the exact layout and styles of a landing page (see "mockup.png"). 
Finished product is here: https://ggriffey.github.io/Replicated-Site/


This took me just under 4 hours, and was a great way to go back and review some of the CSS concepts 
I needed to brush up on (like flexbox and alignment/positioning of items, border attributes, etc.).

Although I had never tried to recreate a website as precisely as possible, I think I did a decent job...
I couldn't find the font that was used in the mockup, meaning some of the elements inherently look a little
off. I also had to guess on the color of the image placeholder, but broadly speaking I'm happy with the end
result and how closely it represents the goal layout of the site.
